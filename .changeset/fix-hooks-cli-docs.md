"@codluv/versionguard": patch
---

### Fixed

- Hook scripts now use `npx --no-install` to prevent accidentally downloading an unscoped package when `@codluv/versionguard` is not installed locally
- CLI version is now read from `package.json` at runtime instead of being hardcoded, so it stays in sync with changesets bumps
- Config test no longer uses hardcoded absolute paths, fixing CI failures on GitHub Actions

### Added

- `check --json` flag for machine-readable version check output (CI and agent workflows)
- "Using with Changesets" documentation section explaining how the two tools complement each other
