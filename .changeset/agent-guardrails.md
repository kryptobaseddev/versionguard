"@codluv/versionguard": minor

### Added

- **Agent guardrails** with `--strict` mode on `validate` and `doctor` commands
- New guard module detecting bypass patterns:
  - `HOOKS_PATH_OVERRIDE` — `core.hooksPath` redirecting away from `.git/hooks`
  - `HUSKY_BYPASS` — `HUSKY=0` environment variable disabling hooks
  - `HOOK_MISSING` — required hooks not installed
  - `HOOK_REPLACED` — hook files overwritten without versionguard invocation
  - `HOOK_TAMPERED` — hook files modified from expected template
  - `HOOKS_NOT_ENFORCED` — hooks enabled but `enforceHooks` is false
- Guard report included in `--json` output for CI and agent workflows
- Public API: `runGuardChecks()`, `checkHooksPathOverride()`, `checkHuskyBypass()`, `checkHookIntegrity()`, `checkEnforceHooksPolicy()`
